# Kmeans_Knn_functions

These are the functions for Kmeans and Knn. I have not used any library other than Numpy and Pandas.

Please keep in mind that these are the funtions only. You will need to import your own dataset. Please follow the below instructions
for how your data should be before putting it in the functions. Also, refer the comments in the code too.

Kmeans:-

For Kmeans function, the data must contain all the numerical values.

Knn:-

For Knn function, the data must contain all the numerical values. The first column of the data set must contain the Labels. The label values must be in the form of 0,1,2,3 etc.
